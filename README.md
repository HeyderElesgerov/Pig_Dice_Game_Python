# Pig_Dice_Game_Python
A game that you play with 1 dice!    ---Rules---     Number of players: 1 (You versus Computer)     Number of dice: 1      1) Decide who will start by having each player roll a dice – the one with the highest score starts the game.     2) A player’s turn starts by rolling only one dice. The player continues to roll the dice again, as long as he does not roll a 1 or decides to add his points to his overall score.     Each time the player rolls the dice, the following options exist:         ~ The player rolls a 1 – his turn ends without any points (he also loses the points from any previous rolls in the current turn).         ~ Any other number than a 1 is rolled – the player can add that number to the points scored in his current turn and continue by rolling the dice again.         ~ The player decides to end his current turn and add all the points from his turn to his overall score.     3) The game ends when a player has reached 100 points and becomes the winner of the game!
